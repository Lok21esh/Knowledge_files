Creating a Symlink


Let's suppose folder A - /var/log/folderA(or)fileA - if you need to create a symlink to this file or folder with same or different name in another location suppose /home/user/


execute the symlink command

	ln -s /var/log/fileA /home/user/symlinkfileA


now the symlink is created, go to the other location and validate


	cd /home/user/ 
	ls


you can see a file created with symlink here, it showsup like this
	
symlinkfileA -> /var/log/fileA


whatever changes happen in /var/log/file will be replicated in symlinkfileA
